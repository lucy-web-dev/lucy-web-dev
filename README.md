Hi, I’m lucy! 👾

Think of me as the human equivalent of an if statement—always looking for opportunities, solutions, and the occasional debugging session in life.

I code in digital marketing, script in affiliate campaigns, and deploy dreams into the metaverse. 🖥️✨ Whether it’s optimizing traffic, flipping NFTs, or merging Web2 with Web3, I’m all about making systems run smoother—except my coffee machine (still debugging that one ☕).

Here’s my tech stack:

	•	Frontend: Creative marketing campaigns, eye-catching visuals, and UI/UX flair.
 
	•	Backend: Data-driven strategies, SEO wizardry, and affiliate ROI optimizations.
 
	•	Database: Brain filled with ideas for building engaging communities and connecting worlds (and a little room for memes).

Fun facts:

	•	My favorite function is console.log("Why isn’t this working?!").
 
	•	I sometimes overthink processes, but hey, even the best algorithms need fine-tuning.
 
	•	I’m on a mission to bridge Web2 affiliate marketing and Web3’s metaverse, even if it feels like connecting JavaScript with Fortran. (Spoiler: It’s hard, but possible!)

Here’s what I dream about when I’m not debugging my life:

	•	Web3 Deal Bots: Imagine a bot that crawls for deals, validates them, and mints a unique NFT for each verified offer.
 
	•	Metaverse Loyalty Program: Users earn tokens for completing challenges, like posting deals or sharing insights.
 
	•	Creator Economy Tools: Allow creators to embed NFT galleries on affiliate websites, blending commerce with creativity.

If you’re into digital deals, Web3 wizardry, or just bantering about code, NFTs, and random internet chaos, let’s connect! 🚀

“Life’s just a giant debug session. Let’s find the bugs and create something awesome together.” 💡
